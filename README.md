# beak.data
data files for beak_api (and other?)

The data may be used for initializing the DB when bootstrapping a new server.
In the future, if future sites would share the DB from start, we might include some DB dumps.

Currently, the data was scraped from existing conference websites.
Current sites:
* [PyConIL 2016](../../tree/master/pyconil2016_old) - copied from the mobile app's data on.
* [PyConIL 2017](../../tree/master/pyconil2017) - scraped (see README file there).

TODO:
* August Penguin 2017 - need to scrape from the [conf website](http://ap.hamakor.org.il/2017/).
