Once the code gets into IR it doesn\u2019t matter what platform it was originally written on, and it doesn\u2019t matter that Python can be slow. It doesn\u2019t matter if you have weird CPUs - if they are supported by LLVM it will run.<br/><br/><br/>What is Tupleware?<br/><br/>TupleWare is an analytical framework built at Brown University that allows users to compile functions into distributed programs that are automatically deployed.

PyLLVM is a simple, easy to extend, one-pass static compiler that takes in the subset of Python most likely to be used by Tupleware.

Using your image, it will launch instances of different types in defined regions and will execute test cases in parallel. How? All test cases are represented as a Directed Acyclic Graph structure \u2013 parents and children. Then these test cases are assigned to workers by a modified BFS algorithm that allows processing of sibling test cases in parallel. It includes test result processing tools such as a Bugzilla module to report bugs for you. 3rd-party test case modules are supported too.<br/><br/>This tool is used by Red Hat QE for RHEL image release sanity testing in EC2, however Fedora images and OpenStack cloud are supported too.
