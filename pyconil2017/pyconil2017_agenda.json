The oVirt Python SDK is a library that simplifies the usage of its API for Python developers. It is intended to remove from the Python developer the burden of handling XML and HTTP, while granting access to all the functionality of the oVirt API. A key aspect of the Python SDK is that it is automatically generated from the specification of the API. It has always been like that, since its very inception. In version 4 of oVirt a new version of the API was introduced, together with a much more strong specification. That gave us the opportunity to re-architect the Python SDK, with the following goals in mind: * Make sure that all the API functionality can be used, now and in the future, automatically generating Python code that can be kept backwards compatible. * Drastically improve the performance of the Python XML parsing and rendering code, specially for large data sets. * Enable asynchronous HTTP, and pipe-lining of HTTP requests. This is of utmost importance for environments with high latency.

Python is dominating this development niche because manual memory management is very important for numeric computing, and CPython exposes an efficient and practical API for low-level extensions. The rest of the Python ecosystem also relies on low-level extensions --- Python would be of little use for web programming without fast libraries for JSON and XML parsing, image manipulation and database connectivity. However, most Python users have little love for these native extensions that they rely on. Native extensions impose some inconveniences. More things can go wrong, and they're necessarily exceptional and less dynamic.</span></p>\n<p><br><span>In this talk, I'll argue that the Python community ought to accept native extensions as a necessary good, instead of a necessary evil. The language would get stronger at its strengths by ending its ambivalence about native extensions, and investing in better tooling. Individual developers would benefit from getting comfortable dropping down into Cython, and understanding how to read and build native libraries.

The methodology is based on collecting streams of system calls produced by all or selected processes on the hosts, and sending them over the network to an analytics server, where machine learning algorithms based on LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) are used to identify changes in process behavior, due to malicious activity, hardware failures, or software errors. System call streams are enormous, and an efficient representation with performance guarantees independent of the level of activity on the host must be used. Some earlier work was based on processing of sequential streams of system calls, which does not scale well. Other approaches rely on computing frequencies of short sequences (n-grams) of system calls over a fixed time window. However, in this case information about temporal dynamics of the process is lost. In our methodology, vectors of counts of system calls are collected and sent for every monitored process at fixed short time intervals, e.g., 1 second. However, the analytics server processes sequences of system call vectors over longer time spans. This way, the performance guarantee is maintained through sending fixed amount of data per time unit independently of the activity on the host, but the temporal behavior is at least partially preserved. By varying the vector and sequence time durations, a balance between network and CPU load, on one hand, and monitoring accuracy, on the other hand, can be adjusted depending on performance and accuracy requirements. </span></p>", "speakers": [["Michael Dymshtis", "http://il.pycon.org/wwwpyconIL/speakers/127"]], "title": "Process Monitoring on Sequences  of System Call  Vectors", "track": "PyData", "sessionId": 206, "video": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/XeYABdyxN-Q?autoplay=0&start=0&rel=0", "location": "Wohl Center, Hall #2", "time": "Tue, 06/13/2017 - 11:30", "duration": "30min", "type": "Frontal"}, {"body": "", "speakers": [], "title": "Lunch Break", "track": "Key Notes", "sessionId": 202, "video": null, "location": "Wohl Center, Main Hall", "time": "Tue, 06/13/2017 - 12:00", "duration": "60min", "type": "Break"}, {"body": "<p><span><a data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"f3fb9c6f-ba8e-45af-824e-3db4a6ad7356\" href=\"/wwwpyconIL/sites/default/files/inline-files/Anton-Marchukov.pdf\">Anton-Marchukov.pdf</a>A great set of tools exists to check the source code for compliance with Python coding standards such as PEP 8.

This model has proven extremely powerful at Via. We have developed and deployed the world's first operating system for on-demand dynamic public transit.

We will go through the steps of building complete end- to-end system tests, which includes: deployment, installation and interaction with your application in the testing environment, simulating production scenarios such as making API calls, putting your application behind an HTTP server, testing for scale and more. We will also talk about how to investigate failures, and how these tests can integrate easily with conventional unit-testing frameworks such as PyTest and nose.
